        <p>  The Seattle SeaHawks, on Power play Manager, is an ice hockey team. Founded by matthewtols in the spring of 2018, season 31 had just begun. Matthewtols quickly did his best to build the team into a cup contender. Falling short in the semi-finals, matthewtols realized he had a slight problem. If something didn't happen, the team would go bankrupt. Losing about $600,000 a week, season 31 ended on a poor note. Forced to let two of the best players on the team go, along with two expensive staff, the expenses were cut from $600,000 a day(plus revenue for a total of $600,000 a week), to $400,000 a day. Thus ended the Seattle SeaHawks sophomore year.</p>
        <p>  Even though times were hard, the Seattle SeaHawks pushed through. Signing a new general sponsorship deal worth $500,000 more per week than the previous deal, income started growing. Some minor replacements were made during the off-season and the team was set to go. With a few new teams in the league and top-scorer Harel Otelengi on the roster, partnered with a great passer in Josef Hanus and Mohamed Malmstr√∂m to complete the top forward line, Seattle was ready for another great year.<p/>
